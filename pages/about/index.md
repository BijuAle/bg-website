<div class="about">

Welcome, and thanks for visitng my website. My name is *Bipana Gurung*. Here, I write about my musings and also showcase my photos and graphic designs.

I am from Chitwan, Nepal. Chitwan literally means the life-force of the forest (In Nepali language, चित्त/*citta* means life-force and वन/*vana* means forest). I love nature and am highly    interested in Environmental Science.

I am working as the research assistant in the monitoring, evaluation, and learning unit of a development consulting firm called, *Scott Wilson Nepal* in Kathmandu.
